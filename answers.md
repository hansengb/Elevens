1. Elevens, Thirteens, and Tens all have different specific rules, but the main concept of the game as well as most of the main functions are the same. The only functions that will be different are isLegal() and anotherPlayIsPossible(). The other draw(), shuffle(), etc. methods will be exactly the same.

2. The ElevensBoard classes overrides the variables that were set in Board. The ElevensBoard initially has the same values as Board when they are called from the abstract class, but they are changed when ElevensBoard uses its own functions.

3. Yes, it overrides any necessary functions and variables. Some of the functions are not written yet(They will be written in activity 9).
